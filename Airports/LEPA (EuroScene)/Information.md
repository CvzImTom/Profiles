GSX Profile for EuroScene's fabulous freeware rendition of Palma de Mallorca Airport (also known as Son Sant Joan Airport).

### Features:
- All terminal gates with custom vehicle positions as accurate as possible.
- Custom pushback routes for all stands (excluding some remote stands) with multiple options to be as accurate to reality as possible.
- Airport walkers at all four terminals
- Passenger waypoints for boarding/deboarding (excluding Terminal D for now)
- Custom gate group names (Terminal A, B, C, D + remotes and other remote stands not belonging to a particular terminal all sorted into their own categories to select).
- Correct Safedock T3-9 VDGS positions
- A380-compatible stand on Apron R7

A version 2 of this profile should be expected in the future.

##### All stands/gates in contact with the terminal buildings have fully custom vehicle positions and pushback routes as a minimum, though SOME remote stands are not included.
