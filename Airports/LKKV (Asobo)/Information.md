## Features:
- Custom passenger walk-in paths
- Custom vehicle placements
- Custom pushback routes
- Custom stand groups and stand names

## Known Issues
- Some compromises had to be made with regards to custom vehicle placements and passenger walk-in paths. Passengers have to walk through the adjacent stands, because GSX cannot differentiate between PAX going through the front of the plane and back.
- Stands are incorrectly aligned to their outer markings. In order for it to look good, I had to adapt to the stand taxi line
