This is my GSX-Profile for MkStudios LIRF

This Profile is built new from the ground up with all the latest GSX features. 

## Important Info:

The head of the PAX can stick though the jetway, since the root floor height is correct I cant do anything about that. The model MK-Studios provides is simply to small

Stands 412 and 528 do NOT have a jetway available, due to scenery limitations.

Stand 845 is isolated do NOT use it!

## Features:
- Custom vehicle placement
- Custom pushback positioning and naming (no Pull due to GSX limitation)
- Correct selection of ground handling and catering companies
