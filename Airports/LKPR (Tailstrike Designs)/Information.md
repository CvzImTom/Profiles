## Features:
- Custom vehicle placement on all stands
- Custom pushback routes
- Correct wingspan according to the LKPR AIP
- Tweaked alternate stands in order to be recognized by the GSX
- Custom stand groups and stand names
- Custom stop positions based on the airport documentation

## Known Issues
- Stands 21 and 21A are so close together that there is no way to configure the GSX so it correctly recognizes the user's stand. While being at stand 21, GSX will still recognize it as 21A. However, this shouldn't affect the handling in any way, so you can just ignore it.
- Jetways are not working on some alternate stands. This is an MSFS limitation which I cannot fix.
