## Features:
- Custom vehicle placement on all stands
- Custom pushback routes
- Correct wingspan according to the LKPR AIP
- Tweaked alternate stands in order to be recognized by the GSX
- Custom stand groups and stand names
- Custom stop positions based on the airport documentation

## Intentional features
- Pushbacks on heavy stands without the aircraft pull, have the allowed engine start after the aircraft is in it's final position. This is according to the real airport procedures
- There are also some special pushback routes for larger aircraft on several heavy stands. This is according to the real airport procedures. You may use them on VATSIM / IVAO, just make sure to inform the ATC, if they will not give it to you themselves. For example, stand 22

## Known Issues
- Stands 21 and 21A are so close together that there is no way to configure the GSX so it correctly recognizes the user's stand. While being at stand 21, GSX will still recognize it as 21A. However, this shouldn't affect the handling in any way, so you can just ignore it.
- Jetways are not working on some alternate stands. This is an MSFS limitation which I cannot fix.
