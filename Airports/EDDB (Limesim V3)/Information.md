Please keep in mind that due to the nature of the scenery, clipping of ground vehicles can't be avoided everywhere. However I aim to improve this where possible.

## This profile comes with the following features:
 
- custom VDGS placement
- custom stop positions
- custom pushback options (Vatsim compliant)
- custom engine start positions for Apron B and C
- deicing areas as per charts
- walk-in stands where applicable
- Python customization for accurate stop positions and gate grouping
- Ground Handling: Wisag, AAS
 
Small and Medium Gates done with Fenix A320, Heavy Gates with iniBuilds A330

If you can provide more information on pushback procedures, handling operators etc., please contact me so we can improve the profile together!
