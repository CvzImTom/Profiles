- Parking 7+8 are walk-in from the Ryanair Terminal
- Custom position of vehicles based on Fenix A320 requirements (widebody not tested, but A310/B737 should work likewise)
- Custom pushbacks that don't block service roads (roll through positions don't work due to static obstacles, so all are pushback)
- Custom stopping points (use "reposition aircraft" after spawning to make sure you park as expected)
- Jetway root height customized
- Included .py file to rename parkings and group them into "Terminal" (1-11), "Remote" (12-17) and "Apron 3" (44L) categories for easier selection
