This profile is for ORBX Malmö ESMS scenery (v5.0)
Available from these retailers: [ORBXdirect.com](https://orbxdirect.com/product/esms-msfs)

## Features:

- Custom stop position to align the door (based on Fenix A320) to the jetways. Note this does not always match the ground markings for stop position, it's how the scenery is done
- Custom pax waypoints through jetways and walk-in positions at the terminal
- Terminal walkers for terminal positions (none for remote parkings/cargo
- Custom vehicle placement (note that the scenery has a LOT of clutter and it WILL cause clipping and collisions that I can't avoid)
- Custom pushbacks ("Facing East" only)
- Handler/Caterer setup and airline codes for easier selection
- Optional GSX VDGS version if you prefer it over the provided Nool VDGS (see installation instructions)
- Custom grouping and naming of positions separated by "Apron N" and "Apron S"
