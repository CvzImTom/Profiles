GSX Pro Profile for UK2000's rendition of London City Airport (EGLC) in the heart of the UK's largest city.

This profile includes:
- Fully custom vehicle positions for all stands excluding Jet Centre
- Two stop position configurations, optimised for both the FSS Embraer E190 and the Just Flight Avro RJ/BAe 146
- Passenger waypoints for all applicable stands
- Correct handling and catering operators
- Pushback disabled for all stands
- Gates grouped into their respective aprons (Main, East and West)

**NOTE**: In reality, two marshallers are used to park an aircraft. As this is not possible with GSX, only the **second** (post-turn) marshaller is present.

##### Due to the nature of EGLC's stands, two profiles are required to support multiple different aircraft types.
- If you wish to use the VirtualCol or Flightsim Studio Embraer aircraft, install the `For E190` profile.
- If you wish to use the Just Flight Avro RJ or BAe 146, install the `For RJ/146` profile.

###### I do apologise for the need to install multiple profiles - this is due to the fact that each aircraft type is stopped at a slightly different angle, and this is not possible with one profile as far as I am aware.
