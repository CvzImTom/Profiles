GSX profile for MK Studios' [BIKF Keflavík V2](https://mkstudios.pl/products/keflavik-airport/) scenery

## Features:
- Custom vehicle placement at all gates
- Custom pushbacks as per [Isavia documentation](https://eaip.isavia.is/)
- Python file to group the gates together
- Custom jetway heights to prevent passengers from clipping through the jetways
- Walk-in paths to jetways for passengers
- Walk-in paths where relevant (gate 10)
- Option to use GSX's or Nool's VDGS
- Ground handling by Icelandair and Airport Associates
- Catering by Icelandair
- Accurate stop positions based on aircraft type
- Gates 71R and 72R are disabled as they're too close to gates 71 and 72 which causes issues with GSX recognizing where the airplane is parked
- Basic profile for BIRK Reykjavík with gates 1, 3 and 4 at apron 4 configured with walk-in paths and vehicles for the ATR72

#### Recommended addons:
- [GSX Fuel Hydrant Livery EAK Aviation Fuel Services](https://flightsim.to/file/70850/gsx-fuel-hydrant-livery-eak-aviation-fuel-services) by Saurer01

Always use GSX's "reposition at this gate" feature when starting a flight

##### If using GSX's VDGS, backup and remove the following folder: "MSFS\Community\mkstudios-airport-bikf-keflavik\SimObjects\Landmarks\noolaero VDGS BIKF" to avoid conflicts with the included Nool systems
