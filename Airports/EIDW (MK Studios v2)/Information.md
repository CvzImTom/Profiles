This is my GSX-Profile for MK-Studios EIDW V2
This Profile is mostly complete. The only thing missing is the West and GA Apron. Apart from that, every stand is finished. 

Due to the immense amount of ground clutter, there may be some clipping, let me know which stands are affected and I will see what I can do. 

Big thanks goes to JamesRob747 for helping with parts of Pier 3 and 4. 

Due to MKstudios scenery design, multiple stands are unavailable (144, 145, 311R, 406B, 411T), if these get fixed in a future update I will update the Profile

Some of the jetways at the C Gates seem to be inop. They are immovable with GSX or any other technique 

With thanks also to ElevateStudios and Krake802
